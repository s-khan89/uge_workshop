git_notes

master branch is a lable that git creates for us when we initialize a repository

HEAD is another lable that git creates for us when we create our first commit

HEAD is *not* a branch

#creates a new branch (label) called git-notes
git branch git-notes

#shows us which branch is active
git branch

#git hub is a hub of .git/ directories

you can push and pull commits to and from .git/ directories

you can also clone .git/ directories to new computers or new paths
