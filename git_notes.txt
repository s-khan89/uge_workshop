git_notes

master branch is a lable that git creates for us when we initialize a repository

HEAD is another lable that git creates for us when we create our first commit

HEAD is *not* a branch

#creates a new branch (label) called git-notes
git branch git-notes

#shows us which branch is active
git branch
